# PresElection2020
 A few quick visualizations of 2020 US Presidential Election Results.

Wanted to play around at different ways of looking at votes from the 2020 presidential election.  

Used R choroplethrMaps and mapdeck respectively in the images (mapdeck is an R interface to the combination of the wicked cool mapping and visualization frameworks Mapbox and Deck.gl).

Didn't really like how they turned out, but done screwing off with on a Saturday afternoon.

The second one is really cool as you can move it around freely / and zoom in and out.  Mapbox and Deck.gl are really great.

Also the data for AZ Maricopa county (where we live) seems goofy in the 2nd mapdeck map.  Unless... ... (Arizona results were certified right...?).
